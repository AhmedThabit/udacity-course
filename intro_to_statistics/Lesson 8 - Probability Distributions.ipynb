So, continuous is not correct. And, if you got this wrong, no big deal. The word continuous might not even mean much to you. But, it’s one of these things to know about densities. \n",
    "- Now, smaller or equal to 1, that’s a really tricky one. And, I would submit that’s not correct and here’s why. Suppose you have a density that assigns uniform probability only to values between 0 and 0.1, then the height of this density could be 10; it’s 1 over 0.1. And, as a result, it’s possible that densities can exceed 1. And that is a key point that makes them different from probabilities. Probabilities are always smaller than or equal to 1. Densities can be larger than 1."
